```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

this is the start of the mongoDB document

i connected to the DB that i build in the cloud. 

need to link that pdf document to this markdown.

this defines the connection string to the mongbDB (see documentation),
creates the connection object (an environment in variables) and then queries against the DB.
```{r}
library(mongolite)

con <- 'mongodb+srv://workshop:workshop@workshop-memwm.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true&w=majority'
mongolite::mongo('Restaurants', 'Workshop', con) -> restaurantDB
restaurantDB$find('{}') -> all_data
head(all_data)
```
